# Java Programming Practical Exercises

This repository contains the solutions for a series of Java programming practicals. These practicals are designed to help you become familiar with programming concepts, the IntelliJ development environment, and writing Java applications.

## Practical 1: Introduction to IntelliJ

### Aims and Objectives

The first practical introduces you to the following concepts:

- **Familiarize yourself with the IntelliJ development environment**.
- **Use IntelliJ** to compile and execute Java applications.
- **Identify and correct syntax, semantic, and logical errors** in simple Java programs.
- **Write a complete, small Java application** to practice basic coding skills.

## Practical 2: Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

### Aims and Objectives

The second practical focuses on:

- **Using variables** to store, retrieve, and update values in Java.
- **Constructing arithmetic expressions** that involve variables, literal values, and operators like integer division (`/`) and remainder (`%`).
- **Creating and using input streams** to read text from the keyboard.
- **Converting string inputs** (digits) to integer values for processing.

## Practical 3: Making Decisions

### Aims and Objectives

In this practical, you will learn about decision-making in programs:

- **Introducing selection statements** (if, if-else) to allow programs to make decisions based on values.
- **Enhancing interactivity** by responding to user inputs and conditions.
- **Writing generalized instructions** to apply logic to various conditions and scenarios.

## Practical 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Aims and Objectives

This practical is designed to give you an introduction to object-oriented programming:

- **Defining classes** that can be instantiated and used in the main method of a Java application.
- **Defining methods** within classes and understanding the difference between methods used internally and those intended to be invoked using an object reference.
- **Practicing object instantiation and method invocation** within a class to develop a deeper understanding of OOP concepts.

## Practical 5: Class Design and Modifications

### Aims and Objectives

This practical focuses on:

- **Designing and modifying class definitions**.
- **Extending classes** with additional methods and instance variables.
- **Utilizing selection and iteration statements** to enhance class functionality.

## Practical 6: Class Design and Iteration

### Aims and Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- **Design and modify basic classes** in Java.
- **Use alternative selection and iteration statements** to control the flow of the program.

## Practical 7: Arrays and Data Structures

### Aims and Objectives

In this practical, you will:

- **Declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays** in Java.
- **Define classes** that use arrays as the basis for implementing sequential data structures, such as lists.

## Practical 8: Working with Arrays

### Aims and Objectives

This practical focuses on:

- **Storing, retrieving, and manipulating data** in arrays.
- Gaining further experience working with arrays in different contexts.

## Practical 9: Inheritance in Java

### Aims and Objectives

This practical introduces basic inheritance concepts:

- **Construct Java classes** that extend and modify the behavior of existing classes.
- **Override methods** or add new methods to create subclass functionality.

## Practical 10: Sorting Algorithms

### Aims and Objectives

In this practical, you will:

- **Experiment with sorting algorithms**, observing how they operate using an application.
- **Modify the sorting algorithm** to change how sorting is performed or to output related information.

## Assignment: Final Project

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this assignment, you will:

- **Comprehend basic program control constructs** such as sequence, selection, and iteration.
- **Use integrated development environments and tools** within a programming and version control context.
- **Understand the basics of code management systems** (e.g., Git).
- **Translate pseudocode into a readable, working program**.
- **Apply programming principles** to solve domain-specific problems.
- **Contribute professionally** to a defined information space using programming knowledge and skills.
